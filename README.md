# Milestone Project 1 

## Responsive Website for - Coedseren Healing

### Brief

A local woman with an expanding jewellery, Crystal Healing and Reiki business wants a website to showcase her jewelry, and to provide information about her Reiki and Crystal healing services. The main requirements from the client are:
-	A gallery of her jewellery and links to where they can be bought.
-	Information about her Reiki and Crystal healing services and her qualifications.
-	A means of contacting the client with a view to engage her for healing sessions or wholesale or custom enquiries for her jewellery.

The client already has two social media accounts: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Coedseren), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/Coedseren/), as well as a selling account on [Folksy](https://folksy.com/shops/Coedseren) (a UK version of Etsy).

The site contains the home page with three  sections, a "Wear" page in which is possible to see the types of jewellry available as well as testimonials from happy customers. A "Connect" page in which is possible to see all the available ways to get in touch with the client and send them a request via their contact form, and the thank you page to which the user is redirected after filling out and sending the form.

This website is the first of four projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the project can be found here - https://ahaffg.github.io/coedseren/

### Requirements
A static responsive website that incorporates the technologies I have learned so far that contains some advanced functionality. The development process needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub.
Required technologies: HTML, CSS

## Design
The client already has a logo which is well associated with her brand. The color scheme and aesthetic will be inspired by this. The aesthetic of the website should reflect the healing element of the clients’ services and allow her jewellery to shine.

Since this is my first HTML/CSS project, the design has been influenced by the ”Love Running” and "Whiskey Drop" project.

My goal was to create a website that could transmit to the users, the calm and warm nature of Coedseren's work and at the same time, the quality and beauty of her Jewelry, through a balance between colors, images and functionality.
![Coedseren logo](/assets/images/coedseren-logo.jpg)

### Colours
The main colours used are based on the logo, and form a monochromatic palette using “Gainsboro” and “Grey”.

![Palette](/assets/images/palette.jpg)

## Imagery

- Colour will be added using photographs which will add to the aesthetic. The client already has images of her jewellery products which can be used on the site, and stock images of healing services will act as placeholders until the client is able to provide her own.
- Imagery is important. The large, hero image has been chosen becuse it is calming and also has a welcoming, cosy and healing feel.
- Images have been chosen their color and content. The purpose of the website is to give a calm look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match the design.

![Hero Image](/assets/images/pexels-alina-vilchenko-3610752.jpg)

## Typography

[Laila](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Laila) will be used for the text throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. It is a clean font that is easy to read. It reflects the magical aspect of the clients work whilst still being legible. 

![Laila font](/assets/images/laila.jpg)

## Features

 - Header (Logo/Navigation Bar)

## Wireframes

Mobile Wireframe.

![mobile wireframe](/assets/images/mobile-wireframe.jpg)

Desktop Wireframe.

![desktop wireframe](/assets/images/desktop-wireframe.jpg)

It is likely that the final designs will look a little different as I become more familiar with the technologies and implications of responsive design, however I hope that I will be able to achieve something similar to this. I believe these designs are clean, intuative and encourage interaction and exploration.

I hope that I am also able to demonstrate a wide range of functions within the website without falling prey to "cotent creep" or implementing function over design.

## Initial Design Idea

![initial-design-idea](/assets/images/mockup-look.jpg)

This was my original mock-up which I created in order to get a better idea of layout, and how the colours and images would sit together. I was overall happy with the result, but I was a little concerened it might be too cluttered, which is why I tried to strip as much as possible from the final design.

#### Header With Logo and Navigation Bar Section
  - The Header consists of Coedseren's lgo, that is aligned to the left and a Menu that is aligned to the right.
  - Featured on all four pages, the navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Wear page and Connect page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - In order to make navigation easier between the pages, the navigation bar is fixed on top when the user scrolls up an down.
  - The Header is at a fixed position on top and follows the user as the user scrolls down the page.
  - Although I could have employed a toggle function to colapse the nav bar on mobile devices, I actually really like how it looks in the smaller version. I feel its still legible and looks very stylish so I have decided to keep it as it is.
![Header and navigation](/assets/images/screenshot-logo-and-nav-bar.jpg)
#### Home Page Hero Image Section
  - The Home Page Hero Image Section contains a hero image, header and a paragraph.
  - The section was built to welcome the user and convey a warm and friendly atmosphere.
  - The section also contains a header and a paragraph that gives the user a clear message of what the website is about.
  - The "Hero-Zoom" animation is used to attract the users attention without being too distracting.
![Home Page Hero Header Section](/assets/images/screenshot-home-hero-image.jpg
#### About Me Section
  - In the About Me Sections the user will find out Coedseren's healing journey and her training.
  - The purpose of the About Us section is to give users a feel of who Coedseren is and her mission.
  - The text for this was provided by Coedseren (Emma Towner) herself and as such she hold intellectual rights to this inormation.
![About Me Section](/assets/images/screenshot-about-me.jpg)
#### About Reiki and Crystal Healing Section
  - This section contains two boxes with an image, a heding and a paragraph, each.
  - The purpose of this section is to give the user some extra information about Reiki and Crystal Healing
  - Each box has a picture that shows something related to the topic and that brings the user a feeling of relaxation healing.
  - The text for this peice has been adapted from corresponding Wikipedia articles.
  ![About Reiki and Crystal Healing Section](/assets/images/screenshot-about-reiki-about-crystal-healing.jpg)
#### Footer Section
  - The Footer contains two social media links (Facebook and Instagram) as well as a likn to Coedseren's shop on Folksy (represented with a shopping bag). 
  - The purpose of the Footer is to provide easy access for the user to the different social media platforms where Coedseren has a presence, as well as to her selling account.
  - The footer is repeated across all pages to keep a consistent look and to aid ease of use.
![Footer](/assets/images/screenshot-footer.jpg)
#### Wear Hero Image Section
  - The section contains a banner made of three peices of jewellry made by Coedseren.
  - The title H1 text is again animated and positioned in the same way as the home page, but this time is coloured a dark grey to give some distinction to the page, and also from thee background image.
  - A statement sentence emphasizes Coedseren's values, and leads the viewer into the main paragraph.
![Wear-Hero-Image-Section](/assets/images/wear-hero.jpg)
#### About Jewellry
  - This section has a paragraph about Coedserens jewellry written by herself.
  - Three button links follow the paragraph that give the user the option to go to the clients Folksy shop (which will open in a seperate browser) to make a custom or wholesale enquiry (which will take you to the "connect.html" page) or to skip the gallery and see testimonials from other customers.
  - There is a disclaimer paragraph which has been emboldened to enforce the message, reminding custiomers never to replace doctors advice with complimentary medicine.
  ![about-jewelry](/assets/images/screenshot-about-jewelry.jpg)
#### Gallery
- The jewellry gallery has been designed to be responsive across different media. At its largest it is four images wide and then collapses to 1 image on mobile devices.
- Initially I had planned for the images to be hyperlinked to their individual pages, but I decided against this as there was no way of updating the image automatically should a piece be sold or removed. This would require a lot ofwork from either myself or the client- something neither of us can commit to!
- I also removed the capability of the image to be opened as a larger image, as I could not find a way to create a 'back' link, so the user would have had to use the 'back' button in the browser nav bar.
- All of th images on this page were taken by the clients and I have chosen a variety (along with adaptations of her descriptions) to demonstrate the range and quality of her work.
![gallery](/assets/images/jewellry-gallery.jpg)
#### Testimonial Section
- I felt it was important to include real quotes from some of the reviews the client has recieved on her Folksy selling account, again to reinforce the quality of her products.
- The quotes have been taken directly from floksy along with the star ratings that the customers gave. I have used font awesome icons to achieve this.
- Quotes are seperated with a styled HR rule.
![testimonial-section](/assets/images/testimonials.jpg)
### Contact Hero Image Section
  - This section is designed to be in-keeping with the aesthetic of the rest of the site, and to be welcoming to encourage customers to get in touch.
![Contact-Hero-Image-Section](/assets/images/connect-hero.jpg)
#### Contact Form Section
  - The Contact Form Section has the purpose to let users get in contact with the Coedseren in an informal, easy and fast way.
  - The Form has four input fields where users must give their first name, last name, email address and a message.
  - Users also have the option to check whether or not they would like to opt-in to recieve a monthly newsletter.
  - After sending the request wiht the correct information required in the fields, users will be redirected to a "Thank you" page.
![Contact-Form-Section](/assets/images/contact-form-section.jpg "Contact Form Section")
#### Social Media Links
 - I felt it would also be a good idea to reiforce the option of using the clients social media links.
 - I have used font awesome Icons and labels to direct users.
![social-media-links](/assets/images/screenshot-contact-social-media.jpg)
### Thankyoupage Hero Image Section
 - I chose a rose quartz image to be the hero banner as I felt it converyed a feeling of gratitude.
 - The same hero-zoom animation has been applied to the text for continuity.
 ![thankyou-page-hero-image-section](/assets/images/screenshot-hero-thankyou.jpg)
#### Thankyou Section
- I have included a short paragraph to thank viewer for their message, and to reassure them that their message has been sent and recieved by Coedseren.
![thankyou-section](/assets/images/screenshot-thankyou-message.jpg)

- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Testing 

Testing has been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Testing different devices and screen resolutions has been conducted using Google DevTools.

Listed is the main issues discovered.

1. Home page Hero-Image was not staying on the right place after addding the Hero-Image Text.
 - Solution: Removed it as a background-image from the style.css and moved it to index.html.
2. First colum of the Meditation Group Table shrinked after inserted the data.
 - Solution: Adjusted the data inserted.
3. Hero-Image were not taking 100% of the screen's width.
 - Solution: Resized the images to a larger size.
4. When tested in Lighthouse the website received a low score on performance, 73. The reason for thas was that the images size were too big.
 - Solution: Resized all the images and score increased to 99.
5. Poor performance on smaller screens. About Us and 2022 Events sections did not place them selfs properly.
 - Solution: Solved this by using media queries and now the elements are displayed as they should.
6. Menu not properly aligned with header on small screens and it gets cropped and divided.
 - Solution: Added new values in the existing media queries.
7. Menu still gets cropped on screens with resolutions below 320px. It looks good using Google DevTools but not on a physical device
 - Solution: Solved 20220325 - Removed from Unfixed bugs. Changed View Port Width on fonts in menu.

Apart from these issues there have been several minor issues. The majority of these has been due to miss spelled tags, attributes and other mistakes.
