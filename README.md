# Milestone Project 1 

## Responsive Website for - Coedseren Healing

### Brief

A local woman with an expanding jewellery, Crystal Healing and Reiki business wants a website to showcase her jewelry, and to provide information about her Reiki and Crystal healing services. The main requirements from the client are:
-	A gallery of her jewellery and links to where they can be bought.
-	Information about her Reiki and Crystal healing services and her qualifications.
-	A means of contacting the client with a view to engage her for healing sessions or wholesale or custom enquiries for her jewellery.

The client already has two social media accounts: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Coedseren), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/Coedseren/), as well as a selling account on [Folksy](https://folksy.com/shops/Coedseren) (a UK version of Etsy).

The site contains the home page with three  sections, a "Wear" page in which is possible to see the types of jewellry available as well as testimonials from happy customers. A "Connect" page in which is possible to see all the available ways to get in touch with the client and send them a request via their contact form, and the thank you page to which the user is redirected after filling out and sending the form.

This website is the first of four projects that needs to be completed in order to receive a diploma in Software Development from The Code Institute.

Requirements for the project is that the website has to be static and responsive using HTML5 and CSS3.

A live version of the project can be found here - https://ahaffg.github.io/coedseren/

### Requirements
A static responsive website that incorporates the technologies I have learned so far that contains some advanced functionality. The development process needs to be well documented through a version controls system such as GitHub.
Required technologies: HTML, CSS

## Design
The client already has a logo which is well associated with her brand. The color scheme and aesthetic will be inspired by this. The aesthetic of the website should reflect the healing element of the clients’ services and allow her jewellery to shine.

Since this is my first HTML/CSS project, the design has been influenced by the ”Love Running” and "Whiskey Drop" project.

My goal was to create a website that could transmit to the users, the calm and warm nature of Coedseren's work and at the same time, the quality and beauty of her Jewelry, through a balance between colors, images and functionality.
![Coedseren logo](/assets/images/coedseren-logo.jpg)

### Colours
The main colours used are based on the logo, and form a monochromatic palette using “Gainsboro” and “Grey”.

![Palette](/assets/images/palette.jpg)

## Imagery

- Colour will be added using photographs which will add to the aesthetic. The client already has images of her jewellery products which can be used on the site, and stock images of healing services will act as placeholders until the client is able to provide her own.
- Imagery is important. The large, hero image has been chosen becuse it is calming and also has a welcoming, cosy and healing feel.
- Images have been chosen their color and content. The purpose of the website is to give a calm look and express quality. Images have been sized in order to match the design.

![Hero Image](/assets/images/pexels-alina-vilchenko-3610752.jpg)

## Typography

[Laila](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Laila) will be used for the text throughout the whole website with Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. It is a clean font that is easy to read. It reflects the magical aspect of the clients work whilst still being legible. 

![Laila font](/assets/images/laila.jpg)

## Wireframes

Mobile Wireframe.

![mobile wireframe](/assets/images/mobile-wireframe.jpg)

Desktop Wireframe.

![desktop wireframe](/assets/images/desktop-wireframe.jpg)

It is likely that the final designs will look a little different as I become more familiar with the technologies and implications of responsive design, however I hope that I will be able to achieve something similar to this. I believe these designs are clean, intuative and encourage interaction and exploration.

I hope that I am also able to demonstrate a wide range of functions within the website without falling prey to "cotent creep" or implementing function over design.

## Initial Design Idea

![initial-design-idea](/assets/images/mockup-look.jpg)

This was my original mock-up which I created in order to get a better idea of layout, and how the colours and images would sit together. I was overall happy with the result, but I was a little concerened it might be too cluttered, which is why I tried to strip as much as possible from the final design.

#### Header With Logo and Navigation Bar Section
  - The Header consists of Coedseren's lgo, that is aligned to the left and a Menu that is aligned to the right.
  - Featured on all four pages, the navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Wear page and Connect page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - In order to make navigation easier between the pages, the navigation bar is fixed on top when the user scrolls up an down.
  - The Header is at a fixed position on top and follows the user as the user scrolls down the page.
  - Although I could have employed a toggle function to colapse the nav bar on mobile devices, I actually really like how it looks in the smaller version. I feel its still legible and looks very stylish so I have decided to keep it as it is.
![Header and navigation](/assets/images/screenshot-logo-and-nav-bar.jpg)
#### Home Page Hero Image Section
  - The Home Page Hero Image Section contains a hero image, header and a paragraph.
  - The section was built to welcome the user and convey a warm and friendly atmosphere.
  - The section also contains a header and a paragraph that gives the user a clear message of what the website is about.
  - The "Hero-Zoom" animation is used to attract the users attention without being too distracting.

#### About Me Section
  - In the About Me Sections the user will find out Coedseren's healing journey and her training.
  - The purpose of the About Us section is to give users a feel of who Coedseren is and her mission.

  - The title H1 text is again animated and positioned in the same way as the home page, but this time is coloured a dark grey to give some distinction to the page, and also from thee background image.
  - A statement sentence emphasizes Coedseren's values, and leads the viewer into the main paragraph.
