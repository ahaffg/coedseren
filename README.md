# Milestone Project 1 

## Responsive Website for - Coedseren Healing

### Brief

A local woman with an expanding jewellery, Crystal Healing and Reiki business wants a website to showcase her jewelry, and to provide information about her Reiki and Crystal healing services. The main requirements from the client are:
-	A gallery of her jewellery and links to where they can be bought.
-	Information about her Reiki and Crystal healing services and her qualifications.
-	A means of contacting the client with a view to engage her for healing sessions or wholesale or custom enquiries for her jewellery.

The client already has two social media accounts: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Coedseren), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/Coedseren/), as well as a selling account on [Folksy](https://folksy.com/shops/Coedseren) (a UK version of Etsy).

## User Experience (UX)
### User stories
#### First Time Visitor Goals
-	As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the services and products on offer.
-	As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
-	As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
#### Returning Visitor Goals
-	As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about what happens during a healing session and how to book one.
-	As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.
-	As a Returning Visitor, I want to buy jewellery or commission unique pieces.
#### Frequent User Goals
-	As a Frequent User, I want to be able to place wholesale orders.
-	As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.
-	As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to services or products.

## Design
The client already has a logo which is well associated with her brand. The color scheme and aesthetic will be inspired by this. The aesthetic of the website should reflect the healing element of the clients’ services and allow her jewellery to shine.

### Colour Scheme
The main colours used are based on the logo, and form a monochromatic palette using “Gainsboro” and “Grey”.

## Imagery

- Colour will be added using photographs which will add to the aesthetic. The client already has images of her jewellery products which can be used on the site, and stock images of healing services will act as placeholders until the client is able to provide her own.
- Imagery is important. The large, hero image has been chosen becuse it is calming and also has a welcoming, cosy and healing feel.

## Typography

[Laila](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Laila) will be used for the text throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. It is a clean font that is easy to read. It reflects the magical aspect of the clients work whilst still being legible. 

## Wireframes

Mobile Wireframe.

Desktop Wireframe.

It is likely that the final designs will look a little different as I become more familiar with the technologies and implications of responsive design, however I hope that I will be able to achieve something similar to this. I believe these designs are clean, intuative and encourage interaction and exploration.

I hope that I am also able to demonstrate a wide range of functions within the website without falling prey to "cotent creep" or implementing function over design.

3.	Google Fonts: Google fonts were used to import the 'Laila' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.
4.	Font Awesome: Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes.
5.	Git: Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
6.	GitHub: GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.
7.	Balsamiq: Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

## Testing

### "Home"
Although I could have employed a toggle function to colapse the nav bar on mobile devices, I actually really like how it looks in the smaller version. I feel its still legible and looks very stylish so have decided to keep it as it is.

### "Wear"
*It shoulud be noted that the code for the 'card' elements in this section do not display inline CSS written by myself, but instead are part of the original Bootstrap[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/] code.*
	`<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">`

### "Healing"
This page was originally designed to be a link within the landing page (to demonstrate my ability to link withi pages as well as to other pages)to the large text area, however I thought that on a mobile device it would look better if the contents were more spread out.
