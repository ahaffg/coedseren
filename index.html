            <h2>Using gemstones to make healing elegant and fun.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>My Crystal Healing journey began 17 years ago when I was going through some emotional distress and I
                turned to crystals to help me. After that, I began giving other crystals to family and friends to help
                them in their time of need. After some time, I began making healing jewellery as gifts for loved ones,
                and later opened a shop on Folksy to reach and help more people.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I decided to become a Crystal Healer to help people on a deeper level, and I chose Glastonbury as the
                place to complete my training.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My journey with Reiki began seven years ago when I needed something a little different. I felt the
                benefits of my Reiki treatment immediately and encouraged my friends and family to try it. I decided to
                receive my Level 1 Attunement to be able to give my family and close friends some Reiki healing, and
                went on to receive my Level 2 Attunement so I can help others and also be able to charge my Crystal
                jewellery, and also my Crystal sets with Reiki for added benefit. I received my Reiki Attunments in
                Borth.</p>

                <p id="about-reiki-content">Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing, a type of alternative medicine.
                    Reiki practitioners use a technique called palm healing or hands-on healing through which a
                    "universal energy" is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in
                    order to encourage emotional or physical healing.</p>

                <p id="about-crystal-healing-content">Crystal healing is an alternative-medicine practice that uses
                    semiprecious stones.The practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body, often
                    corresponding to chakras; or crystals are placed around the body to construct an energy grid, to
                    surround the client with healing energy.</p>
