            <br>
            <p class="lead">My Crystal Healing journey began 17 years ago when I was going through some emotional distress and I turned to crystals to help me. After that, I began giving other crystals to family and friends to help them in their time of need. After some time, I began making healing jewellery as gifts for loved ones, and later opened a shop on Folksy shop to reach, and help more people.</p>
            <p>I make a mostly bracelets as I think they the most versatile, and, apart from rings, they are the piece of jewellery that you always see. I like seeing my mine as I type away at my computer or write in my book. I choose the crystals in my jewellery very carefully depending on their healing properties, and also make sure they look pretty. I choose to make my bracelets with strong jewellery elastic as I find clasps extremely fiddly to use. Due to poor grip I can’t always fasten jewellery by myself. I don’t always have someone on hand who can help me fasten jewellery, and I think my bracelets will be suit those in the same situation. It’s very important for me that my bracelets are easy to put on and taken off. All my bracelets have a lifetime guarantee and should they break, they can returned to me and I will be happy to repair them.</p>
            <!--<div id="emma"><img src="/assets/images/emma.jpg" alt="Emma with shining red hair, sitting in a window." ></div>-->
            <p>I like to use sterling silver to make my jewellery as silver enhances the healing properties of the crystals. I know there a people out there who have allergies to silver, therefore the * marked bracelets can be remade with stainless steel beads.</p>
            <p>I decided to become a Crystal Healer to help people on a deeper level, and I chose Glastonbury as the place to complete my training.</p>
            <p>My journey with Reiki began seven years ago when I needed something a little different. I felt the benefits of my Reiki treatment immediately and encouraged my friends and family to try it. I decided to receive my Level 1 Attunement to be able to give my family and close friends some Reiki healing, and went on to receive my Level 2 Attunement so I can help others and also be able to charge my Crystal jewellery, and also my Crystal sets with Reiki for added benefit. I received my Reiki Attunments in Borth.</p>
            <p><strong>Please remember, Reiki and Crystal Healing compliments traditional medicine and should not be used as an alternative. If you are worried about and in need of medical advice, please speak to your doctor.</strong>

                <h5><i><strong>What is Reiki?</strong></i></h5>
                <br>
                <p>Reiki is a Japanese form of energy healing, a type of alternative medicine. Reiki practitioners use a technique called palm healing or hands-on healing through which a "universal energy" is said to be transferred through the palms of the practitioner to the patient in order to encourage emotional or physical healing.</p>

                <h5><i><strong>What is Crystal Healing?</strong></i></h5>
                <br>
                <p>Crystal healing is an alternative-medicine practice that uses semiprecious stones and crystals such as quartz, agate, amethyst or opal. In one method, the practitioner places crystals on different parts of the body, often corresponding to chakras; or else the practitioner places crystals around the body in an attempt to construct an energy grid, which is purported to surround the client with healing energy.</p>
