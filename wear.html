            <h2>A lot of love goes into what I make...</h2>
            <br>
            <p>I mostly make bracelets as I think they the most versatile, and apart from rings, they are the piece of
                jewellery that you always see. I like seeing my mine as I type away at my computer or write in my book.
                I choose the crystals in my jewellery very carefully depending on their healing properties, and also
                make sure they look attractive. I choose to make my bracelets with strong jewellery elastic as I find
                clasps
                extremely fiddly to use. Due to poor grip I can not always fasten jewellery by myself. I do not always
                have
                someone on hand who can help me fasten jewellery, and I think my bracelets suit those in the
                same situation. It is very important for me that my bracelets are easy to put on and taken off. All my
                bracelets have a lifetime guarantee and should they break, they can returned to me and I will be happy
                to repair them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I like to use sterling silver to make my jewellery as silver enhances the healing properties of the
                crystals. I know there a people out there who have allergies to silver, therefore the * marked bracelets
                can be remade with stainless steel beads. I carefully source my stones to ensure they are genuine, AAA
                quality, ethically mined and shaped gemstones. I cleanse and enrich each piece with Reiki. I offer a
                gift wrapping service and can add a message to any order at no extra cost.
                The bracelets come wrapped in tissue paper and placed carefully inside a specially folded Origami pouch.
            </p>
